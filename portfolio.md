## 👨‍💻 About Me
Hi, I’m **David** — a Software Engineer with a passion for data.
After several years building and maintaining scalable systems that collect millions of usage data, I realised the true power of a business lies in the effective use of **data** to uncover insights and drive decision making.

This passion led me to pursue a **Master of Predictive Analytics** at Curtin University, with a focus on Finance and Investment. Through this program, I’ve gained:
- A strong foundation in financial markets and investment strategy
- Hands-on skills in statistical modeling and economic forecasting
- Proficiency in tools like Excel, R, and Python

🎯 I'm actively seeking internship opportunities in Data Science or Business Consulting to apply my skillset to real-world challenges and deliver data-driven value.
