- Does Perth experience a weekly fuel price cycle?
- Are there geographic clusters of high or low prices?
- Which fuel types and brands offer the best value?
- Can prices be predicted based on correlations between fuel types?

### 📊 Key Insights
- Weekly Price Cycle: Perth's fuel prices follow a distinct cycle: Prices peak every Wednesday and gradually decrease until Tuesday, at their lowest. 
- Geographic Price Clustering:
  - North Perth tends to have higher average prices. 
  - South Perth generally offers cheaper fuel options. 
- Brand Comparisons: Some brands consistently offer lower prices for certain fuel types:
  - FastFuel 24/7
  - Costco
  - Burk 
- Fuel Type Correlations:
      Strong pricing correlations were found between fuel types (e.g., 98 RON ↔ PULP ↔ ULP), meaning one can often predict one fuel's price using others.
